The repo  will  be having  code base  of python codes .

#######################  1st .py  file 
In this  my  first  try  is  to  put  some  basic's of connecting  python(3.6)  with  mongodb secoundary db  in server , many people face serious problem's in configuration .



This  configuration.py  file  also  contains  basic  mongo  query operation , to pull data  in various  ways .

################### 3rd .py file 

In  Date_parser.py  file ,  i  had  tried to  include a  awesome  library from natty called as dateparser  to  parse  textual dates  like ,  yesterday  , tomorrow ,  or any other format . It can  extract  dates from  a  string  contain  a date  like below . 

"  my  birthday was tomorrow  "   =  It will  extract tomorrow  and give  tomorrows  date in datetime format
